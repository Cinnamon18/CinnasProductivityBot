# CinnasWritingBot
Writing bot!

# How to Run
 - Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - Change the token in .env to the bot's real token, which you can get on the discord developer page > Application > Bot > Token
	 - If you're deploying, you can just configure the env variable and the .env will be ignored.
 - You probably wanna `git update-index --skip-worktree .env`

# Misc
 - Release branch is autodeployed to [https://cinnaswritingbot.azurewebsites.net](https://cinnaswritingbot.azurewebsites.net)
